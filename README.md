FilterFiesta ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to FilterFiesta, the ultimate tool to rescore and filter your docked ligands and turn your molecular docking results into a grand fiesta of refined and selected poses! ðŸŽŠ
ðŸŽˆ Filters That Join the Party:

- PLIF Filter: Shake up your poses by scoring them based on a selection of residue-ligand interactions. This filter brings the groove to your molecular interactions!
- Clustering: Get your molecules to dance together by clustering them based on their fingerprints. With Butina clustering at a given threshold, we select only one representative per cluster to keep the party smooth and exclusive. ðŸ’ƒ
- Complementarity: Rescore your poses by analyzing the shape complementarity between the ligand and receptor surface. Perfectly matched pairs make for a stellar performance! ðŸŒŸ
- In-Group RMSD: For those with multiple poses per molecule, evaluate the in-group RMSD and use it as a filter. This ensures your party guests (poses) are in harmony and hitting the right notes! ðŸŽµ

ðŸ“œ How To Get Started:

- Prepare Your CSV Table of the docking results:
  Each line should include:
  - Receptor path in PDB format
  - Docked molecules in SDF format
  - Scores in CSV format
- For Interaction Filter, prepare a CSV table with:
  - Residue name (three-letter format)
  - Residue number
  - Chain letter
  - Weight of the relevance of the residue
  - A letter representing the type of interaction
  - The name of the pocket it belongs to

ðŸŽ‰ Let's Get This Party Started!

With FilterFiesta, your molecular docking results will not only be filtered but will dance into a new level of refinement. So, get your data ready and let the fiesta begin! ðŸŽŠ
